# Sensu Client BOSH Release

## What it is

The aims of this release was to enable the following:

* Install the Sensu client in each instance of a Cloud Foundry PaaS deployment using BOSH.
* Provide a script to observe the monit jobs on the instance for failures.
* Have sensu schedule running the script regularly.
* Have the script surface good/bad information for each monit job up to sensu.
* Not use a list of hard-coded monit jobs, so new components will automatically get monitored.
* Output alerts via sensu for a failed/recovered monit job.


##Â What it isn't

* A completley general purpose Sensu client installation in BOSH with all configuration options surfaced.
* Polished. (it uses the sensu .DEB for example instead of compiling everything from scratch).

## Getting Started

### CF Manifest snippets

    releases:
     - name: cf
       version: xxx
     - name: sensu-client
       version: latest
    
    jobs:
     - name: nats
       templates:
        - name: sensu_client
          release: sensu-client
        - name: nats
          release: cf
        instances: 1
        resource_pool: infrastructure
        networks:
          (( merge ))
    
    properties:
      sensu:
        client:
           rabbitmq:
             host: "<Sensu RMQ Host>"
             user: "<RMQ Sensu client user>"
             password: "<Monitoring Client RMQ Password>"
           subscriptions: ["cfmonit"]
           deployment_name: (( meta.name ))
           
The deployment_name sets a prefix for the instances BOSH job name. 
We don't report real hostnames to Sensu as they are pretty useless (BOSH ensure's we get a new one everytime it blows away a VM or updates a stemcell). Instead we report the hostname to sensu as ```job_name.deployment_name```

For example. We use this for our BOSH deployment name, so my 'hostnames' in sensu will be ```dea0.deployment1```  or ```nats0.deployment1``` etc, allowing me to also monitor a different CF deployment, ie ```dea0.deployment2``` with the same Sensu cluster and not get confused.

### Final releases

There are no final releases yet, so you'll need to do the following to upload the release to your bosh director;

    $ git clone https://github.com/FreightTrain/sensu-client-boshrelease.git
    $ cd sensu-client-boshrelease
    $ bosh create release --force
    $ bosh upload release --rebase
    
### Technical Info

#### Startup

The release includes two source files. 

* A debian '.deb' debian package of the standard sensu installation (grabbed directly from Sensu's repo) 
* A custom check script for running monit status/monit summary and parsing the output

the DEB is in the release blobstore, the check script is written (questionably!) in python and under src/

The packaging script just moves the two files to /var/vcap/packages/sensu_client/.
There are also three template files:

    - rabbitmq.json - the configuration file for the sensu client to talk to RMQ
    - client.json - the standard configuration file for the sensu client
    - sensu_client_ctl - a start/stop script based losley on the one from the sensu DEB

The single job, sensu-client then has all the logic (read, hackery) for making the magic happen in it's startup script.

    - Unpacks the DEB at a fake root of /var/vcap/jobs/sensu_client
        - The templated client and rabbitmq .json match up to the needed locations /var/vcap/jobs/sensu_client/etc/sensu/conf.d
        
    - Maps /opt/sensu to /var/vcap/jobs/sensu_client/opt/sensu (ln -s) due to hardcoded paths in Sensu's ruby
    - Moves/updates the custom monit check script into /var/vcap/jobs/sensu_client/etc/sensu/cpgplugins directory (as thats where we have configured the sensu check on the server to execute the script from. Custom DIR for all of our teams plugins)
    
    - Starts sensu
    
#### Normal operation

A Sensu check should be configured on the sensu server attached to subscription 'monitcf' (default name in the release and check script). This executes ```/var/vcap/jobs/sensu_client/etc/sensu/cpgplugins/parsemonit.py``` every 5 seconds.

The script itself then reports the health of each monit job as it's own check (via the localhost:3030 sensu TCP port) speaking sensu's reporting format. Therefore a failed ```nats``` monit job will show in sensu as check type ```nats```

The script queries monit for all jobs and puts them in an error state if they are anything other than 'running', therefore all new monit jobs will be monitored automatically.

Because the script is writing out it's own Sensu style alerts over localhost:3030, the script itself contains some information which needs templating out into the monit configuration, such as:

    - The subscription the reported check is claiming to be on
    - The handlers which should receive the check in sensu-server.
    
I'm currently outputting to twitter at the sensu headend as a demo, using the handler here:
